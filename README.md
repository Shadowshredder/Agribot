# AgriBot â€“ Smart Crop & Fertilizer Recommender

AgriBot is a machine learning-powered agriculture assistant that helps users determine the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions. It also recommends fertilizer corrections and provides detailed, human-like crop care tips including soil suggestions and cultivation advice.

## Features

- Crop recommendation based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- Fertilizer suggestions based on nutrient deviations from ideal NPK values.
- GenAI-style JSON-based crop explanations with care tips and best practices.
- Simple and interactive web interface built using Streamlit.
